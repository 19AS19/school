# Information Systems

> * An Information System is a combination of software and hardware designed for creating, reocording, storing, processing and communicating information.
> * Information systems allow for data analysis which can extract knowledge from data and information, which is otherwise difficult to visualize.

## Example of information systems

* The systems in schools and colleges which have information about:
    * Teachers' and Studens' Timetabels
    * Teachers; class groups
    * Students' academic record
    * Facility for Teachers to enter data on Students' performance and behaviour
    * Bookngs for labs, libraries, computer rooms

Behind the one front end there are multiple files some of which are databases.

# Database

* **Advantages of Databases**
    * Easily store large amounts of data.
    * Multiple users can access the data at the same time.
    * Improved security - data is encrypted and password protected.
