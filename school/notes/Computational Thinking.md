# Computational Thinking                                                        

Computational Thinking is a way of approaching problems that is useful in computing.

It is composed into several techniques

**Pattern Matching**
>This entails idenitfying patterns and recognising when two patterns are similar

**Advantages**
> * Problems are easier to solve when they share patters, as we can use the same problem-solving solution wherever the pattern exists.
> * The more patterns we can find, the easier and quicker our task of problem solving will be.

**Abstraction**
> * Removing all the unnecessary information about the problem so that only the important aspects of the problem remain.
> * It helps to reduce a problem to its essential features and lead to a solution that is simpler, more efficient and faster to implement.

**Using abstraction when designing programs**
> * Functions are a very good example of abstraction in programming
> * The prompt() function in javascript for example - you know what it does and how to use it but you don't need to know what happens to the 
arguments you pass to the function so they apear on the screen - these details are abstracted away.

**Decomposition**
>Breaking a task down into a set of smaller and simpler tasks.

# Algorithms

> * An algorithm is a specific set of step-by-step rules for solving a problem or completing a task.
> * Each step must be so precisely defined that it can be translated into computer language and executed by machine.

**Algorithms must:**
> * have definiteness: Each step must be precisely defined and be unambigous. Computers cannot guess or rely on prior
expereience so every detail and possibility must be accounted for
> * have one or more inputs and outputs
> * have finiteness: Consist of a finite number of steps and terminate. (An infinite number of steps is not really a solution.)

**Features of algorithms**
> * Sequence is the order in which instructions occur and are processed
> * Sequence determines which path a program takes when it is running
> * Iteration is the repeated execution of a section of code when a program
is running.

**Advantages of algorithms**
> * Easy to understand
> * An algorithm uses a definite procedure
> * It is not dependent on any programming language
> * Every step in an algorithm has its own logical sequence so it is easy to debug

**Ways of describing algorithms**
> * Natural language: write out or verballt express a list of steps
> * Flowcharts: to draw each step and show the flow of control
> * Pseudocode: A mix of programming language and everday language to describe instructions less formally than using a programming language
> * Using mathematics.
