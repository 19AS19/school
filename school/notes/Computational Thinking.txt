Computational Thinking is a way of approaching problems that is useful in computing.

It is composed into several techniques

**Pattern Matching**
This entails idenitfying patterns and recognising when two patterns are similar

**Advantages**
>Problems are easier to solve when they share patters, as we can use the same problem-solving solution wherever the pattern exists.
>The more patterns we can find, the easier and quicker our task of problem solving will be.

**Abstraction**
>Removing all the unnecessary information about the problem so that only the important aspects of the problem remain
>It helps to reduce a problem to its essential features and lead to a solution that is simpler, more efficient and faster to implement
