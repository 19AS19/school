# Ohms Law
- An equation which represents the relationship between current, voiltage, and resistance for a DC circuit
- Discovered by Georg Simon ohm and published in his 1827 pape, The Galvbanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically

```
V = I x R

V = Voltage, I = Current, R = Resistance
```

Given any two we can find the missing value.

# Capacitors
- Stores electricity in the form of electric charge
- Not used for long periods of storage like batteries.
- Capacitance is a measure of the amount of charge that a capaciutor can store
- The unit of capacitance is the farad (F)
- Used in volatile memory (RAM) in computers.
- Used in touch screen devices
- Power off indicators - when you turn off an electrical device and the light stays on for a few seconds before going out.

# Transistors
- A tiny electronic switch which allows a small current to 'switch on' a much larger current. They are generally used as switches and amplifiers
- Replaced vacuum tubes - the 1st generation of computers
- Revolutionized computing:
    - More reliable
    - Energy efficient
    - Cost efficient
    - Easier to manufacture
    - Could do the same job as a vacuum tube
    - Allowed supercomputers to be developed

# CPU
- Made up o flots of combinations of logic gates.
- Logic gates allow the CPU to carry out Boolean operations on binary codfe
- Each logic gate has one or more inputs and only one output
- Each logic gate consists of a particular circuit of transistors
- There are billions of transistors in a CPU
